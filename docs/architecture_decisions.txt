Architecture Diagrams: Message Passing Strategy
I noticed that the location service will be expecting a lot of data traffic from users' mobiles device's locations.
 So gRPC messaging is suitable for it. in conjunction with asynchronous message technology like Kafka for better flow with the Postgres databases.
With Connection Service and Person Service, there is not much dependency on it,
 designing a RESTful API would be suitable in this case since it's necessary to get and post data via HTTP and its lesser complexity
